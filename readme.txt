Note:
Make sure that the limit set in the URL is high enough such that it encompasses all connections of all users. 
If not, some users data may start before others (eventhough though the other users also have active connections in those months).
This is because if youre are comparing a highly active user with an inactive one for lets say 100 connections, 
the active user might reach this number in the second month while for the inactive one we would have to go back many months to reach the last 100 connections.

However, do NOT stress the vatsim api with too many calls.
